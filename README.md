**1. RepeatedGames.ipynb**
This Notebook explores 6 types of repeated games scenarios (Tit-for-Tat, Always Defect, Grim Trigger, Always Cooperate, Generous Tit-for-Tat and Adaptive)
**2. ChainStore.ipynb**

**3. PD_on_Torus.ipynb**

## Installation
To run these notebooks, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install the core dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy jupyter
```
## Dependencies
These notebooks require the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` (for numerical computations)
- `pandas` (for data manipulation)
- `matplotlib` (for visualizations)
- `scipy` (for game-theoretic analysis)
- `jupyter` (for running the notebooks)
